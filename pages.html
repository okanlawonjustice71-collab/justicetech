      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I blend creativity with strategy to design visuals that inspire and websites that convert. 
        With a passion for color, typography, and user experience, I bring brands to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not designing, you can find me exploring new design trends, sketching ideas, or hiking in nature. I’m the kid who got kicked out of class for redrawing the textbook diagrams instead of taking notes, then went home and rebuilt the family computer so I could install a cracked copy of Photoshop 7.0. Two decades later I still can’t decide if I’m a graphic designer who codes or a front-end developer who can’t stop kerning, and I’ve stopped trying to choose. My days start at 5:47 a.m. with an espresso that tastes like burnt vinyl and a playlist that jumps from Fela Kuti to Arca to old Nintendo soundtracks; by 6:15 I’m already pushing vectors around in Figma, hunting for the exact moment a layout clicks like a snare drum. I’ve spent the last eleven years turning napkin sketches into full-blown brand ecosystems—logos that mutate into loading animations, color palettes that echo a client’s childhood kitchen, typography that carries the same swing as her grandfather’s handwriting. I’ve watched a single micro-interaction I sketched on a redeye flight boost checkout conversions by 63 %, and I’ve seen a nonprofit I volunteered for triple donations after we replaced their stock photos with hand-painted illustrations from local high-school kids. I build responsive sites the way tailors cut suits: every breakpoint measured, every component given room to breathe, no unnecessary stitches. Webflow, React, Three.js, GSAP—I treat them like different lenses on the same camera, whatever gets the shot. When the screen finally goes dark I trade pixels for 35 mm film, wandering Lagos streets at golden hour hunting for rusted signs and fading murals, or I’m in my tiny balcony greenhouse fussing over scotch-bonnet seedlings like they’re client deliverables. Design is just storytelling with better subtitles, and I’m still that kid who believes the right story, told in the right typeface, can change the temperature in the room. If you’ve got a problem that needs more than a template, a brand that refuses to whisper, or a product that deserves to feel human in every click—let’s talk.
